# Mental Health Analysis from Twitter Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter data to gain insights into public discussions surrounding mental health topics. Utilizing a suite of Python libraries, this project processes and analyzes text data from tweets, focusing on natural language processing techniques to clean, analyze, and draw conclusions from textual data.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Import data from a CSV file representing a collection of tweets.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processes include converting all text to lowercase, expanding shortened words (contractions), and removing non-alphabetic characters such as numbers and punctuation, as well as URLs, to standardize text for analysis.
- **Text Analysis**: Apply NLP techniques including tokenization, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis to extract meaningful patterns and trends from the data.
- **Sentiment prediction**:using decision tree
